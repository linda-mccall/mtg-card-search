Date: 2025-01-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide on a technology for handling routing in the application.
## Decision

We will use expo with react and typescript for navigation. This is the default configuartion for expo.

## Consequences

None, development may be slow because the only developer on the project is back-end focused developer and will have to complete typescript training.
