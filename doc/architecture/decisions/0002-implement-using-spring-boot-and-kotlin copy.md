# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2025-01-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a tool to manage dependency management. We also need to decide on a programming language for back end APIs. 

## Decision

We will use spring boot due to wide range of features, documentation and security features.

Kotlin is compatible with spring boot and has many built-in features that will result in cleaner code. 

## Consequences

The solo developer is more familiar with java than kotlin, development will be slower, but it will be a valuable learning exercise.
